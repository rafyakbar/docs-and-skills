# Validation

## [​](#introduction)Introduction

Validation rules may be added to any [field](/docs/5.x/forms/overview#available-fields). In Laravel, validation rules are usually defined in arrays like `['required', 'max:255']` or a combined string like `required|max:255`. This is fine if you’re exclusively working in the backend with simple form requests. But Filament is also able to give your users frontend validation, so they can fix their mistakes before any backend requests are made. Filament includes many [dedicated validation methods](#available-rules), but you can also use any [other Laravel validation rules](#other-rules), including [custom validation rules](#custom-rules).

Some default Laravel validation rules rely on the correct attribute names and won’t work when passed via `rule()`/`rules()`. Use the dedicated validation methods whenever you can.

## [​](#available-rules)Available rules

### [​](#active-url)Active URL

The field must have a valid A or AAAA record according to the `dns_get_record()` PHP function. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-active-url)

```
Field::make('name')->activeUrl()
```

### [​](#after-date)After (date)

The field value must be a value after a given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-after)

```
Field::make('start_date')->after('tomorrow')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```
Field::make('start_date')
Field::make('end_date')->after('start_date')
```

### [​](#after-or-equal-to-date)After or equal to (date)

The field value must be a date after or equal to the given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-after-or-equal)

```
Field::make('start_date')->afterOrEqual('tomorrow')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```
Field::make('start_date')
Field::make('end_date')->afterOrEqual('start_date')
```

### [​](#alpha)Alpha

The field must be entirely alphabetic characters. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-alpha)

```
Field::make('name')->alpha()
```

### [​](#alpha-dash)Alpha Dash

```
Field::make('name')->alphaDash()
```

### [​](#alpha-numeric)Alpha Numeric

The field must be entirely alphanumeric characters. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-alpha-num)

```
Field::make('name')->alphaNum()
```

### [​](#ascii)ASCII

The field must be entirely 7-bit ASCII characters. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-ascii)

```
Field::make('name')->ascii()
```

### [​](#before-date)Before (date)

The field value must be a date before a given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-before)

```
Field::make('start_date')->before('first day of next month')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```
Field::make('start_date')->before('end_date')
Field::make('end_date')
```

### [​](#before-or-equal-to-date)Before or equal to (date)

The field value must be a date before or equal to the given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-before-or-equal)

```
Field::make('start_date')->beforeOrEqual('end of this month')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```
Field::make('start_date')->beforeOrEqual('end_date')
Field::make('end_date')
```

### [​](#confirmed)Confirmed

The field must have a matching field of `{field}_confirmation`. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-confirmed)

```
Field::make('password')->confirmed()
Field::make('password_confirmation')
```

### [​](#different)Different

The field value must be different to another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-different)

```
Field::make('backup_email')->different('email')
```

### [​](#doesn’t-start-with)Doesn’t Start With

The field must not start with one of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-doesnt-start-with)

```
Field::make('name')->doesntStartWith(['admin'])
```

### [​](#doesn’t-end-with)Doesn’t End With

The field must not end with one of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-doesnt-end-with)

```
Field::make('name')->doesntEndWith(['admin'])
```

### [​](#ends-with)Ends With

The field must end with one of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-ends-with)

```
Field::make('name')->endsWith(['bot'])
```

### [​](#enum)Enum

The field must contain a valid enum value. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-enum)

```
Field::make('status')->enum(MyStatus::class)
```

### [​](#exists)Exists

The field value must exist in the database. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-exists)

```
Field::make('invitation')->exists()
```

By default, the form’s model will be searched, [if it is registered](/docs/5.x/components/form#setting-a-form-model). You may specify a custom table name or model to search:

```
use App\Models\Invitation;

Field::make('invitation')->exists(table: Invitation::class)
```

By default, the field name will be used as the column to search. You may specify a custom column to search:

```
Field::make('invitation')->exists(column: 'id')
```

You can further customize the rule by passing a [closure](/docs/5.x/forms/overview#closure-customization) to the `modifyRuleUsing` parameter:

```
use Illuminate\Validation\Rules\Exists;

Field::make('invitation')
    ->exists(modifyRuleUsing: function (Exists $rule) {
        return $rule->where('is_active', 1);
    })
```

Laravel’s `exists` validation rule does not use the Eloquent model to query the database by default, so it will not use any global scopes defined on the model, including for soft-deletes. As such, even if there is a soft-deleted record with the same value, the validation will pass. Since global scopes are not applied, Filament’s multi-tenancy feature also does not scope the query to the current tenant by default. To do this, you should use the `scopedExists()` method instead, which replaces Laravel’s `exists` implementation with one that uses the model to query the database, applying any global scopes defined on the model, including for soft-deletes and multi-tenancy:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->scopedExists()
```

If you would like to modify the Eloquent query used to check for presence, including to remove a global scope, you can pass a function to the `modifyQueryUsing` parameter:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->scopedExists(modifyQueryUsing: function (Builder $query) {
        return $query->withoutGlobalScope(SoftDeletingScope::class);
    })
```

### [​](#filled)Filled

The field must not be empty when it is present. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-filled)

```
Field::make('name')->filled()
```

### [​](#greater-than)Greater than

The field value must be greater than another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-gt)

```
Field::make('newNumber')->gt('oldNumber')
```

### [​](#greater-than-or-equal-to)Greater than or equal to

The field value must be greater than or equal to another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-gte)

```
Field::make('newNumber')->gte('oldNumber')
```

### [​](#hex-color)Hex color

The field value must be a valid color in hexadecimal format. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-hex-color)

```
Field::make('color')->hexColor()
```

### [​](#in)In

The field must be included in the given list of values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-in)

```
Field::make('status')->in(['pending', 'completed'])
```

The [toggle buttons](/docs/5.x/forms/toggle-buttons), [checkbox list](/docs/5.x/forms/checkbox-list), [radio](/docs/5.x/forms/radio) and [select](/docs/5.x/forms/select#valid-options-validation-in-rule) fields automatically apply the `in()` rule based on their available options, so you do not need to add it manually.

### [​](#ip-address)Ip Address

The field must be an IP address. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-ip)

```
Field::make('ip_address')->ip()
Field::make('ip_address')->ipv4()
Field::make('ip_address')->ipv6()
```

### [​](#json)JSON

The field must be a valid JSON string. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-json)

```
Field::make('ip_address')->json()
```

### [​](#less-than)Less than

The field value must be less than another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-lt)

```
Field::make('newNumber')->lt('oldNumber')
```

### [​](#less-than-or-equal-to)Less than or equal to

The field value must be less than or equal to another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-lte)

```
Field::make('newNumber')->lte('oldNumber')
```

### [​](#mac-address)Mac Address

The field must be a MAC address. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-mac)

```
Field::make('mac_address')->macAddress()
```

### [​](#multiple-of)Multiple Of

The field must be a multiple of value. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#multiple-of)

```
Field::make('number')->multipleOf(2)
```

### [​](#not-in)Not In

The field must not be included in the given list of values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-not-in)

```
Field::make('status')->notIn(['cancelled', 'rejected'])
```

### [​](#not-regex)Not Regex

The field must not match the given regular expression. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-not-regex)

```
Field::make('email')->notRegex('/^.+$/i')
```

### [​](#nullable)Nullable

The field value can be empty. This rule is applied by default if the `required` rule is not present. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-nullable)

```
Field::make('name')->nullable()
```

### [​](#prohibited)Prohibited

The field value must be empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-prohibited)

```
Field::make('name')->prohibited()
```

### [​](#prohibited-if)Prohibited If

The field must be empty *only if* the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-prohibited-if)

```
Field::make('name')->prohibitedIf('field', 'value')
```

### [​](#prohibited-unless)Prohibited Unless

The field must be empty *unless* the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-prohibited-unless)

```
Field::make('name')->prohibitedUnless('field', 'value')
```

### [​](#prohibits)Prohibits

If the field is not empty, all other specified fields must be empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-prohibits)

```
Field::make('name')->prohibits('field')

Field::make('name')->prohibits(['field', 'another_field'])
```

### [​](#required)Required

The field value must not be empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required)

```
Field::make('name')->required()
```

#### [​](#marking-a-field-as-required)Marking a field as required

By default, required fields will show an asterisk `*` next to their label. You may want to hide the asterisk on forms where all fields are required, or where it makes sense to add a [hint](#adding-a-hint-next-to-the-label) to optional fields instead:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required() // Adds validation to ensure the field is required
    ->markAsRequired(false) // Removes the asterisk
```

If your field is not `required()`, but you still wish to show an asterisk `*` you can use `markAsRequired()` too:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->markAsRequired()
```

### [​](#required-if)Required If

The field value must not be empty *only if* the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-if)

```
Field::make('name')->requiredIf('field', 'value')
```

### [​](#required-if-accepted)Required If Accepted

The field value must not be empty *only if* the other specified field is equal to “yes”, “on”, 1, “1”, true, or “true”. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-if-accepted)

```
Field::make('name')->requiredIfAccepted('field')
```

### [​](#required-unless)Required Unless

The field value must not be empty *unless* the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-unless)

```
Field::make('name')->requiredUnless('field', 'value')
```

### [​](#required-with)Required With

The field value must not be empty *only if* any of the other specified fields are not empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-with)

```
Field::make('name')->requiredWith('field,another_field')
```

### [​](#required-with-all)Required With All

The field value must not be empty *only if* all the other specified fields are not empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-with-all)

```
Field::make('name')->requiredWithAll('field,another_field')
```

### [​](#required-without)Required Without

The field value must not be empty *only when* any of the other specified fields are empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-without)

```
Field::make('name')->requiredWithout('field,another_field')
```

### [​](#required-without-all)Required Without All

The field value must not be empty *only when* all the other specified fields are empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-without-all)

```
Field::make('name')->requiredWithoutAll('field,another_field')
```

### [​](#regex)Regex

The field must match the given regular expression. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-regex)

```
Field::make('email')->regex('/^.+@.+$/i')
```

### [​](#same)Same

The field value must be the same as another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-same)

```
Field::make('password')->same('passwordConfirmation')
```

### [​](#starts-with)Starts With

The field must start with one of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-starts-with)

```
Field::make('name')->startsWith(['a'])
```

### [​](#string)String

The field must be a string. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-string)

```
Field::make('name')->string()
```

### [​](#unique)Unique

The field value must not exist in the database. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-unique)

```
Field::make('email')->unique()
```

If your Filament form already has an Eloquent model associated with it, such as in a [panel resource](/docs/5.x/resources), Filament will use that. You may also specify a custom table name or model to search:

```
use App\Models\User;

Field::make('email')->unique(table: User::class)
```

By default, the field name will be used as the column to search. You may specify a custom column to search:

```
Field::make('email')->unique(column: 'email_address')
```

Usually, you wish to ignore a given model during unique validation. For example, consider an “update profile” form that includes the user’s name, email address, and location. You will probably want to verify that the email address is unique. However, if the user only changes the name field and not the email field, you do not want a validation error to be thrown because the user is already the owner of the email address in question. If your Filament form already has an Eloquent model associated with it, such as in a [panel resource](/docs/5.x/resources), Filament will ignore it. To prevent Filament from ignoring the current Eloquent record, you can pass `false` to the `ignoreRecord` parameter:

```
Field::make('email')->unique(ignoreRecord: false)
```

Alternatively, to ignore an Eloquent record of your choice, you can pass it to the `ignorable` parameter:

```
Field::make('email')->unique(ignorable: $ignoredUser)
```

You can further customize the rule by passing a [closure](/docs/5.x/forms/overview#closure-customization) to the `modifyRuleUsing` parameter:

```
use Illuminate\Validation\Rules\Unique;

Field::make('email')
    ->unique(modifyRuleUsing: function (Unique $rule) {
        return $rule->where('is_active', 1);
    })
```

Laravel’s `unique` validation rule does not use the Eloquent model to query the database by default, so it will not use any global scopes defined on the model, including for soft-deletes. As such, even if there is a soft-deleted record with the same value, the validation will fail. Since global scopes are not applied, Filament’s multi-tenancy feature also does not scope the query to the current tenant by default. To do this, you should use the `scopedUnique()` method instead, which replaces Laravel’s `unique` implementation with one that uses the model to query the database, applying any global scopes defined on the model, including for soft-deletes and multi-tenancy:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->scopedUnique()
```

If you would like to modify the Eloquent query used to check for uniqueness, including to remove a global scope, you can pass a function to the `modifyQueryUsing` parameter:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->scopedUnique(modifyQueryUsing: function (Builder $query) {
        return $query->withoutGlobalScope(SoftDeletingScope::class);
    })
```

### [​](#ulid)ULID

The field under validation must be a valid [Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier](https://github.com/ulid/spec) (ULID). [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-ulid)

```
Field::make('identifier')->ulid()
```

### [​](#uuid)UUID

The field must be a valid RFC 4122 (version 1, 3, 4, or 5) universally unique identifier (UUID). [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-uuid)

```
Field::make('identifier')->uuid()
```

## [​](#other-rules)Other rules

You may add other validation rules to any field using the `rules()` method:

```
TextInput::make('slug')->rules(['alpha_dash'])
```

A full list of validation rules may be found in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules).

## [​](#custom-rules)Custom rules

You may use any custom validation rules as you would do in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#custom-validation-rules):

```
TextInput::make('slug')->rules([new Uppercase()])
```

You may also use [closure rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#using-closures):

```
use Closure;

TextInput::make('slug')->rules([
    fn (): Closure => function (string $attribute, $value, Closure $fail) {
        if ($value === 'foo') {
            $fail('The :attribute is invalid.');
        }
    },
])
```

You may [inject utilities](/docs/5.x/forms/overview#field-utility-injection) like [`$get`](/docs/5.x/forms/overview#injecting-the-state-of-another-field) into your custom rules, for example if you need to reference other field values in your form. To do this, wrap the closure rule in another function that returns it:

```
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

TextInput::make('slug')->rules([
    fn (Get $get): Closure => function (string $attribute, $value, Closure $fail) use ($get) {
        if ($get('other_field') === 'foo' && $value !== 'bar') {
            $fail("The {$attribute} is invalid.");
        }
    },
])
```

## [​](#customizing-validation-attributes)Customizing validation attributes

When fields fail validation, their label is used in the error message. To customize the label used in field error messages, use the `validationAttribute()` method:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->validationAttribute('full name')
```

## [​](#validation-messages)Validation messages

By default Laravel’s validation error message is used. To customize the error messages, use the `validationMessages()` method:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->unique(// ...)
    ->validationMessages([
        'unique' => 'The :attribute has already been registered.',
    ])
```

### [​](#allowing-html-in-validation-messages)Allowing HTML in validation messages

By default, validation messages are rendered as plain text to prevent XSS attacks. However, you may need to render HTML in your validation messages, such as when displaying lists or links. To enable HTML rendering for validation messages, use the `allowHtmlValidationMessages()` method:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->required()
    ->rules([
        new CustomRule(), // Custom rule that returns a validation message that contains HTML
    ])
    ->allowHtmlValidationMessages()
```

Enabling this opts out of escaping for validation messages on this field. Make sure every message — including those from custom rules or translations — is safe to render. Untrusted content can lead to XSS.

## [​](#disabling-validation-when-fields-are-not-saved)Disabling validation when fields are not saved

When a field is [not saved](/docs/5.x/forms/overview#preventing-a-field-from-being-saved), it is still validated. To disable validation for fields that are not saved, use the `validatedWhenNotDehydrated()` method:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->saved(false)
    ->validatedWhenNotDehydrated(false)
```
