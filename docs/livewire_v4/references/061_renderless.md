The `#[Renderless]` attribute skips the rendering phase of Livewire's lifecycle when an action is called, improving performance for actions that don't modify the component's view.

## Basic usage[¶](#basic-usage "")

Apply the `#[Renderless]` attribute to any action method that doesn't need to re-render the component:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Renderless;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function mount(Post $post)

    {

        $this->post = $post;

    }

 

    #[Renderless]

    public function incrementViewCount()

    {

        $this->post->incrementViewCount();

    }

};


```

```
<div>

    <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

    <p>{{ $post->content }}</p>

 

    <div wire:intersect="incrementViewCount"></div>

</div>


```
The example above uses `wire:intersect` to call `incrementViewCount()` when the user scrolls to the bottom. Since `#[Renderless]` is applied, the view count is logged but the template doesn't re-render—no part of the page is affected.

## When to use[¶](#when-to-use "")

Use `#[Renderless]` when an action:

- Only performs backend operations (logging, analytics, tracking)
- Doesn't modify any properties that affect the rendered view
- Needs to run frequently without causing unnecessary re-renders


Common use cases include:

- Tracking user interactions (clicks, scrolls, time on page)
- Sending analytics events
- Updating counters or metrics
- Performing background operations


## Alternative approaches[¶](#alternative-approaches "")

### Using skipRender()[¶](#using-skiprender "")

If you need to conditionally skip rendering or prefer not to use attributes, you can call `skipRender()` directly in your action:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    public function incrementViewCount()

    {

        $this->post->incrementViewCount();

 

        $this->skipRender();

    }

};


```


### Using the .renderless modifier[¶](#using-the-renderless-modifier "")

You can also skip rendering directly from the element using the `.renderless` modifier:

```
<button type="button" wire:click.renderless="incrementViewCount">

    Track View

</button>


```
This approach is useful for one-off cases where you don't want to add an attribute to the method.
