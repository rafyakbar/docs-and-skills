The `#[Async]` attribute allows actions to run in parallel without being queued, making them execute immediately even if other requests are in-flight.

## Basic usage[¶](#basic-usage "")

Apply the `#[Async]` attribute to any action method that should run in parallel:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/post/⚡show.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

use App\Models\Post;

 

new class extends Component {

    public Post $post;

 

    #[Async]

    public function logActivity()

    {

        Activity::log('post-viewed', $this->post);

    }

};


```

```
<div wire:intersect="logActivity">

    <!-- Logs activity asynchronously when element enters viewport -->

</div>


```
When `logActivity()` is called, it executes immediately without blocking other requests or being blocked by them.

## When to use[¶](#when-to-use "")

Use `#[Async]` for fire-and-forget operations where the result doesn't affect what's displayed on the page:

- **Analytics and logging** - Tracking user behavior, page views, or interactions
- **Background operations** - Triggering jobs, sending notifications, or updating external services
- **JavaScript-only results** - Fetching data via `await $wire.getData()` that will be consumed purely by JavaScript


Here's an example tracking external link clicks:

```
<?php // resources/views/components/⚡external-link.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $url;

 

    #[Async]

    public function trackClick()

    {

        Analytics::track('external-link-clicked', [

            'url' => $this->url,

            'user_id' => auth()->id(),

        ]);

    }

};


```

```
<a href="{{ $url }}" target="_blank" wire:click="trackClick">

    Visit External Site

</a>


```
Because tracking happens asynchronously, the user's click isn't delayed by the network request.

## When NOT to use[¶](#when-not-to-use "")

Async actions and state mutations don't mix

**Never use async actions if they modify component state that's reflected in your UI.** Because async actions run in parallel, you can end up with unpredictable race conditions where your component's state diverges across multiple simultaneous requests.

Consider this dangerous example:

```
// Warning: This snippet demonstrates what NOT to do...

 

<?php // resources/views/components/⚡counter.blade.php

 

use Livewire\Attributes\Async;

use Livewire\Component;

 

new class extends Component {

    public $count = 0;

 

    #[Async] // Don't do this!

    public function increment()

    {

        $this->count++; // State mutation in an async action

    }

};


```
If a user rapidly clicks the increment button, multiple async requests fire simultaneously. Each request starts with the same initial `$count` value, leading to lost updates. You might click 5 times but only see the counter increment by 1.

**The rule of thumb:** Only use async for actions that perform pure side effects—operations that don't change any properties that affect your component's view.

## Alternative approach[¶](#alternative-approach "")

### Using the .async modifier[¶](#using-the-async-modifier "")

Instead of using the attribute, you can make specific action calls async with the `.async` modifier:

```
<button wire:click.async="logActivity">Track Event</button>


```
This approach is useful when you want the action to be async in some places but synchronous in others.
